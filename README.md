# OpenCV sample

This script processes images using OpenCV. It reads an image or captures a frame from a USB camera, applies preprocessing (grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and OtsuÅfs thresholding), and saves the processed image.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R-Tatara/opencv-sample.git
cd opencv-sample
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```Bash
python -m opencv_sample
```
